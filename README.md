# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Final-Project
## This is the final project of the course Getting and Cleaning Data.
In this project all tasks are done in a single script called "run_analysis.R". The tasks are as follows
* Download and store data into local system.
* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set obtained after task-4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
